**Microbiome Analysis** is the analysis of a community of microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses) that inhabit a particular environment. The understanding of microbial community profiles from a specific environment, its dynamics, and clearer understanding of microbial role in the environment will provide us a huge lift on scientific discoveries and the initiation of further research for the improvement of human lives.

With the development bioinformatics tools and package in R, microbiome analysis is getting more easier and accessible than ever. This book is made with the intention to bring microbiome analysis closer to you. This book hopefully shed a light on how microbiome analysis is performed, providing a comprehensive review and tutorial on the process of transforming microbiome raw data into valuable insight. Happy reading!
