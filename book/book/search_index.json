The understanding of microbial community profiles from a specific environment, its dynamics, and clearer understanding of microbial role in the environment will provide us a huge lift on scientific discoveries and the initiation of further research for the improvement of human lives. With the development bioinformatics tools and package in R, microbiome analysis is getting more easier and accessible than ever. This book is made with the intention to bring microbiome analysis closer to you. This book hopefully shed a light on how microbiome analysis is performed, providing a comprehensive review and tutorial on the process of transforming microbiome raw data into valuable insight. Happy reading! "],
["microbiome-and-beyond.html", "Chapter 1 Microbiome and Beyond", " Chapter 1 Microbiome and Beyond Our earth has always been a home for billions of magnificent species that captivated the eye, including us. Every living thing occupies their respective habitat and evolves with it. But there are more than what is seen with the eyes! An abundant number of tiny organisms–even unseen to the naked eyes–has also been living with us all along. These tiny organisms are called microbes. Microbes are single-cell organisms that are approximately 1-5 micrometer in size, consisting of various species of bacteria and fungi (some said that viruses are also included). Although microbes are the smallest forms of life, they live in almost every place on earth, even inside our bodies. They have adapted to thrive in the normal and the most extreme condition on earth. [picture of cell size comparation of microbes + microbial timeclock] Microbes live as a community and exchange various chemicals and nutrients that support their own growth and affect the ecosystem around them. For example, the oxygen we breathe in is the result of the past microbial activity of cyanobacteria from around 2.4 billion years ago, which risen the earth’s oxygen level and introduced what called as the great oxygenation event. Recent research also showed that a particular community of microbes lives inside our gut and can perform symbiotic relationships with us. It can secrete chemicals that boost our digestive system, prevent attack by harmful bacteria or viruses, program our immune system, and even direct our appetite, in exchange for a living space. In contrast, a particularly bad community of microbes can also live inside our gut and linked with a higher risk of several disorders including allergies, obesity, diabetes and many types of cancer [^1: Temraz et al]. This specific microbial community that lives in a particular environment is what we called as microbiome. The microbiome evolves as the environment evolves. This is why the microbiome has been linked with the unseen force that supports and maintains the earth as well as the biological profile that describes that specific environment. [picture of healthy/obese gut microbiome] Microbiome is often used to describe a specific condition of an environment. From our previous example, the gut microbiome profile can act as a biomarker for a healthy gut or a specific type of disease. The understanding of microbiome is also very powerful for environmental study. This study answers questions such as, What kind of community of microbes lives in a polluted river? What it consist of? In what way does each microbes from that community affect the environment they live in? Which microbes can act as a biomarker for polluted or unpolluted river? What actions that may recover or worsen the state of polluted river based on its microbial community (by utilizing the knowledge on microbial activity that may affect the environment), and so much more. The study that focuses on the discovery and the understanding of the microbiome is called Microbiome Analysis. It aims to discover microbial community profiles from a specific environment, understand the community dynamics in various conditions, and provide a clearer understanding of their role in the environment. In practice, this study often results in new findings for biomarkers that can be used to detect specific diseases or conditions in health and environmental studies. Further research may also open the door for the development of personalized diet or treatments! [picture of microbial diversity and the biomarker] Although microbiome analysis is mainly focused on discovering patterns from a community, it acts as a solid example of how explanatory data analysis can play a huge role in scientific discoveries and initiate further research for the improvement of human lives. In the next section, we will uncover what are the steps that build up a microbiome analysis and what is the idea behind them. "],
["microbiome-analysis-workflow.html", "Chapter 2 Microbiome Analysis Workflow", " Chapter 2 Microbiome Analysis Workflow The workflow of microbiome analysis has evolved through out the years. The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) and Bioinformatics has made a massive increment on the generation of genomic data that is used for microbiome analysis. Therefore, the use of programming tools such as R and its packages is becoming more widely used. If I may put it into 2 major steps, microbiome analysis consist of the Lab Work and the Bioinformatic Analysis. The lab work of a microbiome analysis is quite plenty and mostly technical, which I will not explain it detail in here. Meanwhile, the bioinformatic analysis will be explained in this book with some tutorial. We will be using R languages and its packages as bioinformatics tools. We will first discuss about the lab work of microbiome analysis. Every lab work of a microbiome analysis begins by taking a sample of microbial community from either soil, water, swab of a surface, saliva, or any other habitat. The microbes present in that sample will then be filtered and extracted for their DNA. Each microbial DNA will be sequenced to retrieve its genetic code, specifically in the region of 16S rRNA gene. For those of you who are not familiar with cell and molecular biology, these are a brief explanation. DNA is a molecule that harbors genes or sequences of genetic code of a living things. This DNA can be used as a taxonomic marker that differentiate each microbial species from one another. A specific region of DNA called the 16S rRNA gene is usually used for comparation, for this gene exist in all of microbes but has slightly different sequence for each microbes. The difference between each sequence will be calculated to determine how distant or related a microbial species with one another. After we have the sequencing result, the bioinformatic analysis can be performed. In brief, this steps aims to compare the sample DNA sequences to the annotated DNA sequences in biological database (ie. GenBank or personal database). This is to determine each microbes identity. After all microbes from the community has been identified, we can analyze the community structure and diversity by calculating the abundance of each microbes. We will able to know which microbes dominates over the other, what microbial activities it can do that may affect the environment being studied, etc. This microbial community profile will help us understand the phenomenon happen in a specific environment. We may even discover potential biomarker for industrial application. From the technical side, the steps of bioinformatic analysis starts from the dirty data cleaning, performing some data pre-processing, followed by applying some algorithms, and finalized by some data visualization and extracting valuable insight. Below is the more detailed steps, adapted from [Callahan et al, 2016] which also featured in Bioconductor [footnote on Bioconductor] website. Amplicons bioinformatic: from amplicons read to tables Data cleaning: trim and filtering Data pre-processing: Infer sequence variants Data pre-processing: construct sequence tables &amp; remove chimeras Assign taxonomy Microbiome analysis: multiple sequence alignment to construct phylogenetic tree Microbiome analysis: community structure, abundance, and diversity Microbiome analysis: community profile visualization using PCA Microbiome analysis: Supervised learning Microbiome analysis: graph analysis using network visualization "]
